# Crypto ToolKit

**Crypto ToolKit** is a web-based tool built with **React** that allows you to encode and decode text using the **Vigenère cipher**. It also supports **live translation**, custom alphabets, and key modes like **Repeat** and **AutoKey**.  

This project is ideal for learning about cryptography, React hooks, and dynamic UI updates.
